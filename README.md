### Python to md converter(Kinda).

#### How to use

* Run main.py with python files that have to be converted into md file at the same directory as the main.py script.
* Programs that require user input will also work, but the terminal won't promt the user with text 
    * For example, if 4.py is the program that will prompt for user input, the terminal output will be like
    ``` bash
    ...
    Executing 4.py
    6 # The user input.
    ```
    * The converted md file won't have this input. It has to be manually entered.
